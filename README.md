## Prerequisites

Before running the Commvault MCP Server, ensure the following requirements are met:

### 1. Python Environment

* Python 3.11 or higher
* [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager (used for dependency management and running the server)

### 2. Authentication & Security Configuration

The Commvault MCP Server supports two authentication methods:

<details>
<summary>Option 1: OAuth Authentication</summary>
<br/>

> **Note:** OAuth authentication is only supported for Commvault environments running **SP42 CU 27 and above**.
> OAuth must be properly configured in the CommServe before using this option.

When using OAuth authentication, you'll need:

* **Discovery Endpoint URL:** The OAuth discovery/metadata endpoint
* **Client ID:** Your OAuth application's client identifier
* **Client Secret:** Your OAuth application's client secret
* **Required Scopes:** Required OAuth scopes
* **Base URL:** Base URL of the MCP Server

> **Important:** The redirect URI must be set to `OAUTH_BASE_URL/auth/callback` in your OAuth provider's app/client configuration.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Option 2: Traditional Token-Based Authentication</summary>
<br/>

The following values will be collected during the setup process:

* **Commvault Access Credentials:**
  You need a valid `access_token` and `refresh_token` to authenticate with the Commvault API.
  Learn how to generate these tokens here: [Creating an Access Token – Commvault Docs](https://documentation.commvault.com/11.38/expert/creating_access_token.html)
  
* **Secret Key:**
  This secret must be included by the **MCP Client** in the `Authorization` header of all tool requests.
  It acts as a security layer for tool access in remote server. You can set your own.

> **Important:** When using traditional token-based authentication, the setup script requires a secure, OS-native keyring backend to store sensitive credentials securely. Only secure backends are allowed for security reasons.

#### Supported Secure Backends by Platform

| Platform | Supported Backends | Description |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Windows** | `WinVaultKeyring`, `WinCredentialStore` | Uses Windows Credential Manager (Windows Vault) for secure storage |
| **macOS** | `macOS Keyring` | Uses the native macOS Keychain for secure storage |
| **Linux** | `SecretService` (GNOME), `KWallet` (KDE) | Uses Freedesktop Secret Service API (GNOME) or KWallet (KDE) for secure storage |
</details>

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Commvault/commvault-mcp-server.git
cd commvault-mcp-server
```

### 2. Run the Setup Script

The setup script will guide you through configuration options including:
- Transport mode (stdio, streamable-http, or sse)
- Server connection details (for remote modes)
- Authentication method (traditional tokens or OAuth)
- OAuth configuration (if selected)
- Secure token storage

```bash
uv run setup.py
```

### 3. Start the MCP Server

```bash
uv run -m src.server
```
<details>
<summary>Secure Production Deployment</summary>
<br/>

For production deployments, it is recommended to use a reverse proxy with TLS/HTTPS and security headers. The MCP server should bind to `127.0.0.1` (localhost only) to prevent direct public access.

### Quick Setup

1. **Configure MCP Server for localhost**: Set `MCP_HOST=127.0.0.1` in your `.env` file
2. **Install reverse proxy**: Choose nginx or Caddy
3. **Configure TLS**: Use Let's Encrypt for automatic certificate management
4. **Add security headers**: Configure [OWASP-recommended](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#security-headers) headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, CSP, etc.)
5. **Update client config**: Use `https://your-domain.com/mcp` instead of `http://HOST:PORT/mcp`

</details>

## Configuring Clients

> **Note:** `npx` is required while using Token-Based Authentication. You can get it by installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) which includes `npx` by default.

<details>
<summary>While using OAuth</summary>
<br/>

Refer to your AI client’s documentation for integration steps. For example, Claude requires specifying a server name and the MCP server URL in its connector configuration.

## Additional Configuration

> **Note:** These are optional configurations that extend the MCP server's capabilities.

<details>
<summary>Trusted Proxy Configuration</summary>
<br/>

When deployed behind a reverse proxy or load balancer, configure `TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS` environment variable with comma-separated proxy IP addresses to enable per-client rate limiting using the `X-Forwarded-For` header. For example:

```bash
export TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS="10.0.0.1,10.0.0.2,192.168.1.100"
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Salesforce Backup Integration</summary>
<br/>

The Salesforce integration enables browsing of backed-up Salesforce records stored in Commvault. It provides two tools:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_salesforce_client` | Resolves a Salesforce Organisation ID (15- or 18-character) to the corresponding Commvault `clientId` |
| `get_salesforce_records` | Fetches backed-up records for a Salesforce object (e.g. `Account`, `Contact`, `Opportunity`) from the latest backup snapshot |

### Prerequisites

1. **Environment Variable**: Set `ENABLE_SALESFORCE_TOOLS=true` in your environment
2. **Commvault Salesforce Backup**: At least one Salesforce organisation must be configured and backed up in Commvault

### Usage Example

To browse backed-up `Account` records for a Salesforce org:

```
Get all backed-up Account records for Salesforce org 00D2w000005mBCpEAM
```

The tool will automatically resolve the org ID to a Commvault client and return the latest backed-up records.

### Parameters for `get_salesforce_records`

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `salesforce_org_id` | Yes | Salesforce Organisation ID (15 or 18 characters) |
| `object_name` | Yes | Salesforce API object name (e.g. `Account`, `Contact`) |
| `limit` | No | Max records to return (default `50`, max `1000`) |
| `offset` | No | Pagination offset (default `0`) |
| `free_query` | No | Optional WHERE-clause filter (e.g. `"Name = 'Acme'"`) |

</details>

<details>
<summary>DocuSign Backup Integration</summary>
<br/>

The DocuSign backup integration enables backup of completed DocuSign envelopes to a Commvault S3 vault. This integration provides comprehensive document management capabilities including backup, listing, and restore operations.

### Prerequisites

1. **Environment Variable**: Set `ENABLE_DOCUSIGN_TOOLS=true` in your environment
2. **Commvault S3 Vault**: Configure an S3 endpoint in Commvault
   - Learn more: [Getting Started with S3 Vault](https://documentation.commvault.com/11.42/software/getting_started_with_s3_vault.html)
3. **DocuSign API Access**: Valid DocuSign integration credentials

### Configuration Files

Create the following files in the `config/` directory:

#### 1. DocuSign Configuration (`docusign_config.json`)

Based on the template file `config/docusign_config_template.json`:

```json
{
  "docusign": {
